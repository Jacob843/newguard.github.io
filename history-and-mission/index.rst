Newguard's History and Mission
==============================

Hedgemage's Story

    Something funny happened a few years ago. Google came out with a feature
    by which a user can have his or her account turned over to a third party
    after a certain period of inactivity, to essentially will it to someone .
    A few infrastructure devs set their accounts to go to me.

    "Why?" I asked. "Why me instead of your co-developer or spouse?"

    "You", they answered, "Are the only one of us under 50". 

    One of my coworkers, a bright Linux hacker named Mark Krenz, started
    calling me "the godmother of the internet". That's when it hit me: Someday
    these guys are really going to start dying off, and I cannot maintain so
    much computing infrastructure by myself. 

    I find myself standing in a strange and wonderful place, a sort of bridge
    between generations. I'm 32 years old, but the programmers I work with are
    all closer to my father's age than mine. I'm part of this younger
    generation, but I was brought up by the old, and I think like them. 

    I started New Guard to give my age peers what I got by stumbling onto
    USENET and IRC when I was 12, and being brought up by the fathers of the
    internet as I know it. 


#newguard on irc.freenode.net was founded on February 17th, 2015 as a place
for early- and mid-career developers to get to know one another and explore
whether apprenticeship in an internet infrastructure project is a good fit for
them.
