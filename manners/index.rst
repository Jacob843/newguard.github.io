Manners
=======

Infrastructure developers, especially of the "old-school" type, abide by a
different set of social conventions than are generally accepted in the rest of
the world, even including casual open source software projects.

These projects exist in a world where time is at a premium. The people with
the most expertise generally have the least disposable time, whereas those
with the least expertise often have more. 

How not to waste an expert's time
---------------------------------

* Try to solve the problem yourself before asking. Read the documentation;
  throw a few relevant queries into your search engine of choice. Bonus points
  for including where you looked as part of the query. 

* Be clear about precisely what your question is. Bonus points for
  anticipating their next follow-up question, and answering it pre-emptively. 

* Optionally, motivate them to help you by preventing others from having to
  ask the same question.

Bad:
   
    Does anyone here know about Rust?

Better: 

    I'm trying to follow the instructions for compiling Rust at <link> but I'm
    getting the error <pastebin link>. What should I do?
