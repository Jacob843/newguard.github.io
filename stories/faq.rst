Frequently Answered Questions
=============================

Is Newguard for students?
-------------------------

Newguard is not meant to be your first exposure to open source. We're looking
for people who have already been involved with open source communities and
know that they're interested in taking the next step toward long-term
involvement with an infrastructure project. If you're an early or mid-career
professional who happens to be in academia at the moment, we won't turn you
away, but if you're a student interested in exploring whether open source is
right for you, we'll direct you toward other resources. 

What do I need to know to get involved?
---------------------------------------

Newguard doesn't have the resources to teach you the basics of open source
culture. You'll be most successful here if you can already use an issue
tracker, participate in IRC and mailing list discussions, and use basic Git
commands without assistance. 

If you're interested in joining an infrastructure project in a development or
testing role, you should also have completed a simple project (such as an IRC
bot with basic functionality) in a systems language such as C, C++, or Rust. 

Knowing when to ask questions is the most difficult-to-teach skill that we
appreciate in Newguard people. 

Where should I start?
---------------------

Join #newguard on irc.freenode.net. 

What classes should I take to learn this?
-----------------------------------------

Open source infrastructure maintenance is not taught in any academic
instituion. Nobody expects school to teach you how to write tests sufficiently
rigorous for a life-critical application; even NASA gives coders 3 years of
full-time internal training before allowing them to touch production code. 

It's okay not to know everything right away, since the only way to learn it is
through mentorship and apprenticeship. 

How can I learn the skills I'll need to get involved with Newguard?

TODO FIXME

Is Newguard a company that hires people?
----------------------------------------

No. Think of it more like a union, club, or secret society.
